5th: finish flag set thing; also dialog scripts in general setup properly
update exiting dialog to use flag setting
test existing dialog trees etc.

plan out darf's area roughly
plan out overall map roughly
write crinkle/finkle dialog
write uranus dialog
write lord pinchly dialog
write snippity dialog(?)
(also decide if any of those characters should be cut)

{UNRELATED:
hp system kinda like smash
attacks stack up damage indefinitely (or maybe to some limit)
attacks also have 'killing power' so e.g. at 100 damage, a move may have 1% chance to kill and at 200 damage, 100% chance to kill
would need to be clearly diisplayed etc.

an rpg battle system where killing the enemy isn't the only way to end combat
e.g. 'knock them all out' or 'try to persuade/threaten'
kind of undertale ish I guess but not necessarily just about pacifism extreme ends etc.
e.g. also a matter of enabling different strategies beyond just always wanting to maximise damage
e.g. attacks with damage ranges: big variance -> more likely to accidentally kill -> smaller variance if want to do more precise things etc.
e.g. poison all enemies -> they have no way to cure -> negotiate by withholding your own cures
would probably need alternate xp system/no traditional xp at all

NPCS:
Darf: - want to grow flowers but no luck with bloom
    - quest to improve garden:
    - ask snippity about better fertiliser or w/e (do some trade); it doesn't work
    - player must investigate flowers via dialog tree like some kind of shitty flower detective
    - report back with evidence: the flowers are on strike to protest their working conditions
    - talk with bee to learn how to negotiate with flowers
    - after gaining the power of floral diplomacy, talk with the flowers to come to an agreement and complete the quest
    - alternatively, agree with the flowers and join their protest, cursing darf to a life of no bloom

Snippity: - merchant who really wants a lamp but only has lemons. rides a lemon as a mount
    - quest to get them a lamp:
    - 

Uranus: - wants to change their name to avoid being the butt (lol) of everyone's jokes.
    -there is an option to laugh at their name every dialog choice in their conversations and taking it more than once will make their quest uncompletable
    - quest choice: help change name or come up with a nickname
    - name change mutually exclusive with pinchly's
    
Lord pinchly: not actually a noble, their first name is literally Lord
    - wants to change name to be less confusing (doesn't say to what but when quest is complete, it becomes King)
    - quest choice: help change name or help them literally become a lord "Lord Lord pinchly"
    - name change mutually exclusive with uranus'
    
    - shared name change quest:
    - enter generic government building
    - the building is shaped like a maze
    - at various points in the maze, have to answer some bullshit question like 'what is address' which don't really matter but all have to be answered to get form
    - one question is relevant as it's the name to fill in of who gets the name change
    - if player tries to reenter maze for a second form they're forced back out with dialog saying they can't take going through all that again or something
    
humblebee: - literally a bee. is humble to the point of insecurity
    - quest to find 
    
crinkle:
    - twin of finkle
    - always tells the truth
    - thinks the whole 'one guard lies/one tells truth' thing is really cool
    - always trying to one up finkle

finkle:
    - twin of crinkle
    - always lies
    - really obvious that they always lie
    - always trying to one up crinkle (but because they are lying, does the opposite and always loses)

dialog process overview:
NPC has filename for its dialog attached to it
CHOICE: either all DialogGraphs are generated on scene load, or only when player first talks to them until scene unloaded - first option probably better
on pressing talk button near/facing NPC (define some collider), Talk() in TalkableNPC() is called
DialogBox is created and populated with start node contents for the conversation, DialogGraphEvaluator created to track location in conversation
Inputs are accepted by [either dialogbox and dialogchoicebox, or just the evaluator]
evaluator accepts inputs and tells the dialogbox + choice boxes what to display
input options are basically 'confirm/continue' and 'pick an option'; can maybe add 'skip' etc. later
pressing 'confirm/continue' either advances to next dialog line (if no choice to be made/edge has multiple lines) or picks an edge and advances it (default selection is first edge in list of appropriate priority etc.)
'pick an option' only does anything when there are options to choose from and just moves up/down the list
when a terminal node is reached, and 'confirm/continue' is pressed, the evaluator destroys itself and so do the dialog boxes
